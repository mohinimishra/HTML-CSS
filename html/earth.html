        <p>Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.</p>

        <h2>Structure and Surface</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Earth is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky.</li>
            <li>Earth's atmosphere is the right thickness to keep the planet warm so living things like us can be there. It’s the only planet in our solar system we know of that supports life. It is mostly nitrogen, and it has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Time on Earth</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A day on Earth lasts a little under 24 hours.</li>
            <li>One year on Earth lasts 365.25 days. That 0.25 extra means every four years we need to add one day to our calendar. We call it a leap day (in a leap year).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Earth’s Neighbors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Earth has just one Moon. It is the only planet to have just one moon.</li>
            <li>Earth has lots of spacecraft watching it. There is still a lot we can learn about our home planet.</li>
            <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system. That means Venus and Mars are Earth’s neighboring planets.</li>
        </ul>
