    <h1 id="intro" class="subtitle">All About Mars</h1>
    <p>Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red
        because of rusty iron in the ground</p>
    <p>Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made
        of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.

        There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds. On some
        Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground.

        Scientists want to know if Mars may have had living things in the past. They also want to know if Mars could
        support life now or in the future.</p>
